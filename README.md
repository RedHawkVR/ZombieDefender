# ZombieDefender

### Description
This is our group's first VR project for CS375: Computer Graphics at Southeast Missouri State University. It's an arena style game that constantly spawns zombies. Try to survive as long as you can. The models used are by Bitgem, drop by their page to check out their work. [bitgem3d.com](https://shop.bitgem3d.com/)

### Purpose
We developed this project mostly to get accustomed to desktop VR development. We did this around Halloween time, so we decided to go with something spooky. This game features the instant teleportation locomotion with boundary checking, and the ability to grab and throw objects. All the other VR specific things are handily taken care of by the SteamVR Plugin.

### Specs
- Unity 2018.2.12f1
- SteamVR Plugin 2.0.1
- Tested with Oculus Rift

## How to Play
Just unzip the ZombieDefenderBuild folder and run ZombieDefender.exe to open the game.

Press the right grip button to start the game.

Click down on the right joystick to spawn a fireball. You may spawn up to 5 at a time.
- You may wonder why we used the joystick for this. It's because we intended to be able to toggle between multiple weapons.

Use the right trigger to grab and throw the fireballs. You may alternatively use either grip button to grab and throw as well.

Use the left trigger to teleport. Just hold down to aim, then release to teleport to the selected destination.

The game isn't set to end. It infinitely spawns zombies for your slaying pleasure.
